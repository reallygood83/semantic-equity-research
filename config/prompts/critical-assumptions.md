# Critical Assumptions Check Template

## Purpose
Surface hidden assumptions in investment theses and challenge them through structured Devil's Advocate questioning and Pre-Mortem analysis.

## Philosophy

> "The most dangerous assumptions are the ones we don't know we're making."

Every investment thesis rests on assumptions about:
- The future state of the market
- Company execution capability
- Competitive dynamics
- Macroeconomic conditions
- Regulatory environment

This framework makes those assumptions explicit and stress-tests them.

## Part 1: Assumption Inventory

### Categories of Assumptions to Surface

**Market Assumptions**:
- Demand will continue/grow
- Pricing power will persist
- TAM estimates are accurate
- Adoption curves are correct

**Execution Assumptions**:
- Management will deliver on guidance
- New products will succeed
- Margins will expand/hold
- Capital allocation will be efficient

**Competitive Assumptions**:
- Moat is durable
- Competitors won't catch up
- Disruption risk is manageable
- Market share is defensible

**Macro Assumptions**:
- Interest rates trajectory
- Economic growth path
- Regulatory stability
- Geopolitical stability

### Confidence Calibration

| Level | Meaning | Evidence Required |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| **High** | Very likely true | Multiple data points, historical precedent |
| **Medium** | Probably true | Some evidence, reasonable extrapolation |
| **Low** | Could go either way | Speculation, limited evidence |

### Impact Assessment

For "If Wrong Impact", consider:
- **Thesis Breaking**: Investment case falls apart
- **Significant**: Major revision to price target needed
- **Moderate**: Some adjustment required
- **Minor**: Thesis still holds with small changes

## Part 2: Devil's Advocate Framework

### Question Types

**Inversion Questions**:
- "What if the opposite is true?"
- "What would make this completely wrong?"
- "Who benefits from us believing this?"

**Temporal Questions**:
- "What if this is true but the timing is wrong?"
- "What if we're 5 years too early/late?"
- "What's the shelf life of this advantage?"

**Second-Order Questions**:
- "What happens after this catalyst plays out?"
- "What are the unintended consequences?"
- "Who else is affected and how will they respond?"

**Historical Parallel Questions**:
- "When has a similar thesis failed before?"
- "What's the base rate for this type of prediction?"
- "What were the warning signs in past failures?"

### Counter-Evidence Sources

For each bullish point, actively seek:
- Bear case analyst reports
- Short seller theses
- Industry expert skepticism
- Historical analogies that failed
- Competitive intelligence

## Part 3: Pre-Mortem Exercise

### The Technique

Imagine it's 12 months from now. The investment has lost 40%. Your task: **Explain what happened.**

This reverses typical forward-looking bias by starting from failure and working backwards.

### Failure Scenario Template

**Scenario Name**: [Descriptive title]

**Trigger Event**:
- What single event initiated the decline?
- Was it internal (execution) or external (market)?
- Was it predictable or a black swan?

**Cascade Mechanism**:
- How did the trigger lead to broader problems?
- What second-order effects occurred?
- Why didn't the company/market recover?

**Warning Signs (Pre-Mortem Indicators)**:
- What early signals would have predicted this?
- What data points should we monitor?
- What's the "canary in the coal mine"?

### Scenario Categories to Consider

1. **Execution Failure**: Company fails to deliver
2. **Competitive Disruption**: New entrant or technology
3. **Macro Shock**: Recession, rate spike, geopolitical
4. **Regulatory Change**: New rules, enforcement
5. **Multiple Compression**: Sentiment shift without fundamentals
6. **Black Swan**: Fraud, disaster, unexpected event

## Output Format Example

### Assumption Inventory

| # | Assumption | Confidence | If Wrong Impact |
|---|------------|------------|-----------------|
| 1 | AI demand will sustain for 3+ years | Medium | Thesis Breaking - removes growth catalyst |
| 2 | CUDA moat prevents AMD competition | High | Significant - margin pressure |
| 3 | China revenue can be replaced | Low | Significant - 20%+ revenue at risk |
| 4 | Gross margins stay above 70% | Medium | Moderate - valuation adjustment |
| 5 | Blackwell launch on schedule | Medium | Moderate - delays catalyst timing |

### Devil's Advocate Questions

1. **RE: AI demand sustainability**
   - "What if AI investment is a bubble similar to 2000 dot-com?"
   - Historical parallel: Cisco in 2000 - "backbone of the internet" thesis collapsed

2. **RE: CUDA moat durability**
   - "What if open-source alternatives (ROCm, Triton) achieve 80% performance parity?"
   - Counter-evidence: AMD MI300X gaining traction in cloud deployments

3. **RE: Valuation justified by growth**
   - "What if growth slows but multiple compresses faster?"
   - Alternative interpretation: 50x P/E requires 50% growth, but law of large numbers

### Pre-Mortem Exercise

> "It's January 2027 and NVDA is down 40% from today. What happened?"

**Scenario A: AI Winter 2.0**
- Trigger: Major AI project failures create skepticism about ROI
- Mechanism: Enterprise AI budgets cut → Data center orders cancelled → Revenue miss → Multiple compression
- Warning signs: Declining AI startup funding, cloud capex guidance cuts

**Scenario B: China Retaliation**
- Trigger: Full China market closure + allies follow
- Mechanism: 25% revenue loss → Supply chain disruption → Competitive response time gained
- Warning signs: Escalating rhetoric, export control expansion, Huawei progress

**Scenario C: Competitive Catch-Up**
- Trigger: AMD/Intel achieve performance parity at lower prices
- Mechanism: Hyperscaler diversification → Pricing pressure → Margin compression
- Warning signs: Cloud customer dual-sourcing announcements, benchmark gaps narrowing
