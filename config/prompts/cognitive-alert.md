# Cognitive State Alert Template

## Purpose
Diagnose the cognitive state of market narratives and investment analysis to identify potential biases and improve decision-making quality.

## Theoretical Foundation

Based on the **Cognitive Variability Framework** from InfraNodus, which maps thinking patterns into four states based on idea diversity and connectivity.

---

## The Four Cognitive States

### 🔴 BIASED (Tunnel Vision)

**Characteristics**:
- Single dominant narrative
- All data points connect to one central thesis
- Alternative perspectives systematically dismissed
- Echo chamber dynamics present

**Indicators in Analysis**:
- Every section reinforces the same conclusion
- Bear case seems weak or perfunctory
- Counter-arguments quickly dismissed
- Heavy reliance on one data source or analyst

**Market Context**:
- Strong consensus (>80% buy ratings)
- Momentum-driven price action
- High short squeeze potential
- Retail trader concentration

**Risk Level**: 🔴 **HIGH** - Likely missing critical information

**Recommended Action**:
> "Actively seek the strongest bear case. Read short seller reports. Consider what would need to be true for the opposite thesis."

---

### 🟡 FOCUSED (Coherent Narrative)

**Characteristics**:
- Strong central thesis with supporting evidence
- Logical flow between arguments
- Some acknowledgment of risks
- Potentially missing edge cases

**Indicators in Analysis**:
- Clear investment thesis
- Evidence well-organized
- Risk section exists but may be shallow
- Few genuine contradictions explored

**Market Context**:
- Moderate analyst disagreement
- Steady institutional accumulation
- Reasonable valuation debates
- Some sector rotation dynamics

**Risk Level**: 🟡 **MODERATE** - Thesis may be correct but incomplete

**Recommended Action**:
> "Your analysis is coherent but may be missing contrarian signals. Expand the critical assumptions section. What's deliberately excluded from this synthesis?"

---

### 🟢 DIVERSIFIED (Multiple Perspectives)

**Characteristics**:
- Multiple competing hypotheses considered
- Bull and bear cases equally developed
- Uncertainty acknowledged explicitly
- Scenario-based thinking present

**Indicators in Analysis**:
- Balanced probability-weighted scenarios
- Genuine engagement with counter-arguments
- Risk factors thoroughly explored
- Position sizing reflects uncertainty

**Market Context**:
- Split analyst opinions
- Mixed institutional signals
- Valuation debates ongoing
- Multiple valid frameworks apply

**Risk Level**: 🟢 **HEALTHY** - Well-balanced perspective

**Recommended Action**:
> "Your analysis is well-balanced. Focus on identifying the key decision variables that would shift your conviction. Monitor those closely."

---

### 🔵 DISPERSED (Chaotic Exploration)

**Characteristics**:
- Too many disconnected threads
- No clear thesis emerges
- Analysis paralysis present
- Contradictory conclusions

**Indicators in Analysis**:
- Sections don't connect coherently
- Both buy and sell seem equally valid
- No clear recommendation possible
- Excessive hedging language

**Market Context**:
- High uncertainty period
- Major regime change possible
- Conflicting macro signals
- Sector in transition

**Risk Level**: 🔵 **UNCERTAIN** - Need to find focus

**Recommended Action**:
> "Too many threads competing for attention. Identify the ONE most important variable. If you had to make a decision today with 60% confidence, what would it be?"

## Classification Process

### Step 1: Narrative Dominance Check

Analyze the market narrative around this stock:

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What's the dominant story? | [Primary narrative] |
| How strong is consensus? | Strong / Moderate / Weak |
| What's being ignored? | [Counter-narrative] |
| Who benefits from this narrative? | [Stakeholders] |

### Step 2: Bias Detection Checklist

Review the analysis for these common biases:

| Bias | Check | Detected? |
|------|-------|-----------|
| **Recency Bias** | Over-weighting last quarter's results | ☐ Yes ☐ No |
| **Confirmation Bias** | Only citing supportive evidence | ☐ Yes ☐ No |
| **Authority Bias** | "Goldman says..." without questioning | ☐ Yes ☐ No |
| **Anchoring** | Fixating on IPO price or 52-week high | ☐ Yes ☐ No |
| **Survivorship Bias** | Comparing only to successful peers | ☐ Yes ☐ No |
| **Availability Bias** | Focusing on recent news over trends | ☐ Yes ☐ No |
| **Optimism Bias** | Best-case assumptions without justification | ☐ Yes ☐ No |
| **Loss Aversion** | Avoiding selling losers, cutting winners | ☐ Yes ☐ No |

### Step 3: State Classification

Based on Steps 1-2, classify the cognitive state:

**Classification Formula**:
- 3+ biases detected + Strong consensus → 🔴 BIASED
- 1-2 biases + Moderate consensus → 🟡 FOCUSED
- 0-1 biases + Split opinions → 🟢 DIVERSIFIED
- Multiple contradictions + No consensus → 🔵 DISPERSED

## Output Format

```markdown
### 🧠 COGNITIVE STATE ALERT

**This Analysis Classification**: [STATE] - [EMOJI]

**Reasoning**:
[2-3 sentences explaining the classification based on narrative analysis and bias detection]

**Narrative Dominance Check**:
- Primary narrative in market: "[The dominant story]"
- Narrative strength: [Strong/Moderate/Weak]
- Counter-narrative presence: "[What's being ignored]"

**Bias Alerts**:
- [x] **[Bias Name]**: [How it manifests in this analysis]
- [ ] **[Bias Name]**: Not detected

**Recommendation for Reader**:
> "[Specific, actionable advice based on the cognitive state]"
```

## State-Specific Interventions

### If BIASED 🔴
- Mandate reading opposing viewpoints
- Increase position sizing caution (reduce by 50%)
- Set pre-commitment rules for exit
- Seek out short seller reports

### If FOCUSED 🟡
- Expand scenario analysis
- Assign probabilities to alternative outcomes
- Identify the "what would change my mind" triggers
- Consider position sizing that reflects uncertainty

### If DIVERSIFIED 🟢
- Proceed with planned analysis
- Focus on monitoring key variables
- Trust the process, manage position size
- Document thesis for future review

### If DISPERSED 🔵
- Step back and identify ONE key question
- Use elimination: "If I had to drop 3 of these threads..."
- Seek external perspective (colleague, mentor)
- Consider waiting for clarity before acting

## Integration with Other Sections

The Cognitive State Alert should:
1. Reference findings from **Event Ontology** (e.g., "The ontology shows X is over-connected")
2. Connect to **Critical Assumptions** (e.g., "2 of 5 assumptions show overconfidence")
3. Inform the **Executive Summary** recommendation
4. Adjust **Position Sizing** guidance accordingly
